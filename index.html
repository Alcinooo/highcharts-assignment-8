<h1>Does student drop-out rates affect how many people are arrested?</h1>

<h2> By Alcino N. Donadel </h2>

<section id= "section1">
<p>Students are regularly told to stay in school by many of society's pillars: parents, teachers, role models, what have you. Consequently, we oftentimes view those students do who do drop out with a negative light. They are seen as juveniles, adding nothing more to society than queue on an officer's schedule. Do we give dropouts too much of a bad rep? Can we aptly correlate dropout rates with the amount of recorded police arrests on a per-year basis? First we will examine dropout rates from highschool students, from the grades 9-12, across three states from years 2008-2011.</p>

<p>Per the data, we can see Arkansas and South Carolina drop-out rates declining at a glacial pace. Oregon was stagnant until 2009 where it experienced an uptick.</p>

<p>Now let's compare the amount of arrests per year for each of the states previously observed.</p>

<p> Just from looking at South Carolina, we cannot observe any real correlation between dropout rates and police arrests correlating per year. While these charts do not speak on the students' future economic status, we can at least say that students who dropout are not going out and getting in trouble with police.</p>
