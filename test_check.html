  <h1>Test and check: First chart with Highcharts (with CDN)</h1>

  <!-- this container div will hold one chart
       it is empty now - JavaScript will write into it -->
  <div id="container"></div>


  <p>This is an example of a simple chart embedded in a Web page. The chart data came from Highcharts: <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart" target="_blank">Your First Chart</a>. The Highcharts Basic Bar Chart demo is <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo/bar-basic" target="_blank">here</a> &mdash; it uses the latest version of the JavaScript code. Note that the chart's <em>bars become thicker</em> if you add height to the CSS for your container DIV.</p>

  <p>Charts are usually placed somewhere in the middle of an article for which the chart provides additional information. Most numerical data is easier for the reader to understand when it appears in chart form. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-graphs-for-data-visualization" target="_blank">Choosing the best chart type</a> to suit your data is very important when you want to communicate the information effectively.</p>

  <!-- be sure to add the script for the chart ABOVE the closing /body tag!
       Note that the script is completely separate from the container DIV
       This script looks for an element with the ID 'container' and then
       writes the chart into that element - note that the ID can be a different
       word, does not need to be 'container', but the two names must MATCH
       -->
  <script>
    Highcharts.chart('container', {
      chart: {
        type: 'bar'
      },
      title: {
        text: 'Fruit Consumption'
      },
      xAxis: {
        categories: ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges', 'Mangoes']
      },
      yAxis: {
        title: {
          text: 'Fruit that was eaten last week'
        }
      },
      series: [{
        name: 'Scott',
        data: [1, 0, 4, 2]

        name: 'Susan',
