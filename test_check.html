  <h1>Test and check: My first chart with Highcharts</h1>

  <!-- this container div will hold one chart -->
  <div id="container"></div>

  <p>This is an example of a simple chart embedded in a Web page. The chart data came from Highcharts: <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart" target="_blank">Your First Chart</a>.</p>

  <p>Charts are usually placed somewhere in the middle of an article for which the chart provides additional information. Most numerical data is easier for the reader to understand when it appears in chart form.</p>

  <!-- be sure to add the script for the chart ABOVE the closing /body tag
       Note that the script is completely separate from the container DIV
       This script looks for an element with the ID 'container' and then
       writes the chart into that element
       -->
  <script>
    Highcharts.chart('container', {
      chart: {
        type: 'bar'
      },
      title: {
        text: 'Fruit Consumption'
      },
      xAxis: {
        categories: ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges', 'Mangoes']
      },
      yAxis: {
        title: {
          text: 'Fruit that was eaten last week'
