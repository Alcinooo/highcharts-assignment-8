# Highcharts and JavaScript (Assignment 8)

This repo contains your assignment starter files, including the [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/download) code.

Highcharts code version: 6.2.0 (updated October 2018).

1. **Fork** this repo (make sure you are logged into GitHub).

2. **Clone** your new repo so you have it on your hard drive. Remember to save it into the folder where you are keeping all your GitHub projects for this course. If you forgot how to fork and clone, see [this](https://github.com/macloo/CSS-and-GitHub-intro/blob/master/README.md).

3. **New branch:** Use your GitHub Desktop app to create a **local branch** named *gh-pages*. **Switch to that branch** and do all your work in that branch. Note that the hyphen and all lowercase letters are essential in the branch name *gh-pages*. If you are confused about *gh-pages* or making a new branch, see the last two pages [in this document](http://bit.ly/newGHapp).

You will NOT submit a pull request.

## Instructions: How to complete the assignment

All instructions for the assignment are [in this document](http://bit.ly/mm-webapps8).

The file *test_check.html* is finished.

The file *first_chart.html* is for your own first chart. You will modify this file.

### Files you will not use in the assignment

* *scripts_bottom.html* demonstrates an alternative way to handle the JavaScript `script` elements, putting them at the *bottom* of the HTML file instead of in the HEAD. They must be ABOVE the closing `body` tag.

* *scripts_bottom_external_chart.html* is identical to *scripts_bottom.html* except in one respect: The code for the Highcharts chart is in an **external file,** *my_chart_code.js*, instead of being included in the HTML.

* *test_check_alternate.html* is identical to *test_check.html* except in one respect: *test_check_alternate.html* uses LOCAL files to load the Highcharts code. The other file (*test_check.html*) uses a **CDN,** meaning the Highcharts files it uses are online.

You can view any of the HTML files by simply opening them in your browser.

## Commit and publish/push

When everything is finished, save all files, and commit and push (publish) to GitHub. Be sure to stay in your *gh-pages* branch for all steps. DO NOT forget to **publish** your repo! Remember, THREE STEPS are necessary:

1. Write a commit message (what you did)
2. Click the commit button (bottom)
3. Click the publish or push button (top)

## Check the rubric and submit in Canvas

Be sure to check the rubric *in the instructions document*, and **SUBMIT THE URL of your GitHub repo in Canvas** to complete this assignment.
