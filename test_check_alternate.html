  <h1>Test and check: A first chart with Highcharts (without CDN)</h1>

  <!-- this container div will hold one chart -->
  <div id="container"></div>

  <p>This is an example of a simple chart embedded in a Web page. The chart data came from Highcharts: <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart" target="_blank">Your First Chart</a>. The Highcharts Basic Bar Chart demo is <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo/bar-basic" target="_blank">here</a> &mdash; it uses the latest version of the JavaScript code. Note that the chart's <em>bars become thicker</em> if you add height to the CSS for your container DIV.</p>


  <!-- be sure to add the script for the chart ABOVE the closing /body tag
       Note that the script is completely separate from the container DIV
       This script looks for an element with the ID 'container' and then
       writes the chart into that element
       -->
  <script>
    Highcharts.chart('container', {
      chart: {
        type: 'bar'
      },
      title: {
        text: 'Fruit Consumption'
      },
      xAxis: {
        categories: ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges', 'Mangoes']
      },
      yAxis: {
        title: {
          text: 'Fruit that was eaten last week'
        }
      },
      series: [{
        name: 'Scott',
        data: [1, 0, 4, 2]
      }, {
        name: 'Susan',
        data: [5, 7, 3, 0]
